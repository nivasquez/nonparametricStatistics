## Abstract

Food carbon emissions is a well known topic among those who study environmental impact and climate change. The food industry is known to be a top contributor in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We have taken data from 130 nations and compared the CO2 emissions among meat and non-meat products, testing which produces more CO2 from a food production standpoint. We begin by testing if the population median for non-meat products is higher than meat products. Non-parametric methods are used since the data for non-meat products CO2 emission is not normally distributed. Our final results come from a binomial test, outlining the difference between CO2 production among our two groups. 

## Motivation

- We want to research the environmental impact that the food industry and diet have on carbon footprint  
- Are carbon emissions for meat and nonmeat foods equal?  

## Background  

- The data is from 2013, and was collected and aggregated in 2018 by nu3, a German health food company. Kasia Kulma used web scraping to collect and format the data for the Tidy Tuesday challenge for the week of February 18, 2020. https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018

# Methods  

<!-- A single hashtag # will create a title type slide to create a clear distinction between sections of the presentation. -->

## Methods Slide 1 - Data Collection

The data was obtained from Github - Tidy Tuesday, and cleaned and reformatted in R. 

$H_0: \theta = 217.84$ 
The population median of CO2 emissions for meat products is equal to the CO2 emissions for non-meat products.  

$H_1: \theta > 217.84$
The population median of CO2 emissions for non-meat products is greater than the CO2 emissions for non-meat products.

## Methods Slide 2 - Analytic Methods
- Nonparametric methods are used because the data for carbon emissions is skewed right.  
```{r}
final = read.csv("Final.csv")
histogram(final$co2_nonmeat+final$co2_meat, xlab= "Carbon Emissions")
```


# Results

## Summary Statistics and Graphics

```{r}
gf_histogram(~co2_meat, data = final,
             xlab = "CO2 Emissions of Meat Products",
             ylab = "Number of Countries")
```

## Summary Statistics and Graphics
Since the data for the CO2 meat column is right skewed, the population median, $\theta$, is a better value than population mean $\mu$ to use for measuring central tendency.
```{r}
gf_histogram(~co2_nonmeat, data = final,
             xlab = "CO2 Emissions of Non-meat Products",
             ylab = "Number of Countries", size = 10)
```

## Summary Statistics and Graphics
```{r}
"CO2 of Non-meat products"
summary(final$co2_nonmeat)
"CO2 of Meat products"
summary(final$co2_meat)
```


## Analysis
Provide analysis using nonparametric methods

```{r}
tally(~co2_meat > 217.84, data = final) #assumed median from hypothesis is that the meat co2 and nonmeat co2 are equal
```

```{r}
pbinom(q= 110-1, size=130, prob = 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) 
```
> There is a 1.496e-16 probability of observing 110 or more values about the true median assuming the true median is \theta= 217.84 kgs/year of co2 emissions, which means that it is HIGHLY unlikely for these numbers to be found by chance. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the CO_2 emissions for meat and nonmeat foods are equivalent, and support the alternative hypothesis that meat foods have greater carbon emissions than nonmeat foods.

```{r}
wilcox.test(final$co2_meat, final$co2_nonmeat, mu=0, alternative = "greater", paired=TRUE)
```

$\eta_\text{m-n} = 0$ 
The median differences in CO_2 levels for meat and nonmeat products is zero.

$\eta_\text{m-n}>0$ 
The median differences in CO_2 levels for meat and nonmeat products is greater than zero. 

# Summary

```{r}
diff=final$co2_meat-final$co2_nonmeat
median(diff)
rank(diff)
min(diff)
max(diff)
```

```{r}
boxplot(final$co2_meat, final$co2_nonmeat, horizontal = TRUE, names = c("Meat","Nonmeat"), xlab= "Kg CO_2/per person/per year")

```


## Conclusion  
>There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis (p=value= 2.2e-16, V = 8289) that the median difference in CO2 Emissions for meat vs nonmeat products is zero. In addition the median difference is MD=223.05 on a scale -170.96 to 1532.24. Therefore, we have evidence to support the claim that the production of meat products produces more CO_2 than the production of nonmeat products.

> Based on our binomial test, we conclude that there is a significant difference between the emissions associated with producing meat and the emissions associated with producing non-meat foods. 


## Future Work

> The data should be gathered and tested for more years than just 2013, so as to attempt to establish a trend.

```{r Notes}
#wilcoxon, permutation. #paired data by country. consider paired analysis by country. compare whether or not most countries produce more co2 overall. do countries produce more co2 from meat or plant?
